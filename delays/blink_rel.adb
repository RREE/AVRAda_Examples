--  we have to explicitely import this function as it gets called via
--  the delay statement. The avr-gnatbind does not yet know that the
--  Ada.Calendar.Delay-routines call Clock and that it must be
--  included in the elaboration code. All of the timer and clock
--  infrastructure gets initialized by elaborating the body of
--  AVR.Real_Time.Clock_Impl.
--
--  AVR.Real_Time.Clock uses AVR.Config (for the quartz frequency) and
--  AVR.Timer0 to generate interrupts at 1000Hz, ie. every 1ms.  The
--  delay routine continuously compares the current time with the end
--  of the delay time for returning. To save power the mcu is put into
--  sleep mode after every tick.
